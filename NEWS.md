# ppforest2 0.1.3

## New features

- `summary()` on a classification tree or forest now reports a per-class error rate alongside each confusion matrix, and prints the overall error rate above the matrix rather than below it. A class with no observations in the data is shown as `-` rather than `nan%` — this happens when the model predicts a class that never appears as an actual label, for example when predicting on a subset of the data.
- Text sizes in the tree structure plot are configurable through options (`ppforest2.text_edge`, `ppforest2.text_tick`, `ppforest2.text_leaf`, `ppforest2.text_proj`), and `ppforest2.text_scale` multiplies all of them at once for rendering the plot large.

## Bug fixes

- Projection coefficients in the tree structure plot are formatted to three significant digits instead of two fixed decimals, matching the axis tick labels in the same plot. The projector is normalized so the values it projects always have the same spread whatever the units of the input data, which leaves its coefficients at a magnitude set by the data rather than by the split; the iris root projector `.00429 / -.0391 / .0259 / .0335` rendered as `.00 / .04 / .03 / .03`, merging the two petal terms and dropping sepal length to zero.
- `pptr()` and `pprf()` no longer abort with the internal error `Grouping::init: partition must be rooted at row 0` when the response's class blocks are contiguous but ordered by decreasing factor level (for example a two-class factor whose first row is its second level, or the bundled `crab` dataset with default alphabetical levels). The classification path now sorts the response into ascending group-id order whenever it is not already, matching the regression path and the command-line tool.
- The resolved thread count is clamped to at least 1 — `hardware_concurrency()` may report 0, and a non-positive OpenMP thread count is undefined behavior.

## Packaging and build

- The vendored C++ core uses `Eigen::indexing::all` instead of `Eigen::all`, which Eigen 5 no longer accepts as an index, so the package builds with the upcoming RcppEigen release based on Eigen 5 as well as with the current one based on Eigen 3.4.0.

# ppforest2 0.1.2

## CRAN

- Fixed a `-Wdeprecated-declarations` warning reported by CRAN's macOS/M1mac additional check (Apple clang 21, macOS 26 SDK). The newer libc++ deprecates `std::char_traits<unsigned char>`, which the vendored nlohmann/json instantiates through its binary output/stream adapters (`std::basic_string<std::uint8_t>` / `std::basic_ostream<std::uint8_t>`). ppforest2 does not use the nlohmann/json binary formats, so the vendored `json.hpp` is now bracketed with a `_Pragma` guard that suppresses the deprecation. `_Pragma` (unlike `#pragma`) is not flagged by `R CMD check`'s pragma check. The guard is applied by `make r-vendor-deps` (`scripts/vendor-guard-json.sh`).

# ppforest2 0.1.1

## Packaging and build

- The package now compiles the C++ core directly through `Makevars` instead of CMake, with no network access or downloaded dependencies at install time. Eigen is provided by RcppEigen; nlohmann/json and pcg headers are vendored under `inst/include`. This makes the package installable on CRAN's offline build machines.
- Self-registering strategies are compiled directly into the shared object, removing the previous whole-archive linking workaround.
- Compiler flags mirror the standalone C++ build — `EIGEN_NO_AUTOMATIC_RESIZING` on all platforms and `EIGEN_DONT_VECTORIZE` on Windows.
- Replaced C++20 designated initializers and fixed member-initialization order in the vendored core so it compiles warning-free under a strict C++17 GCC (`-Wall -Wextra -pedantic`).
- A compile-time `EIGEN_VERSION_AT_LEAST(3, 4, 0)` guard fails the build with a clear message if an incompatible Eigen is supplied via RcppEigen.
- `make r-vendor-deps` re-vendors the committed json/pcg headers after a version bump.

## Documentation

- `DESCRIPTION` uses `Authors@R` and cites the projection-pursuit tree and forest references with DOIs.
- Examples for the parsnip and plot methods use `\donttest` with `requireNamespace()` guards instead of `\dontrun`, so they run under `--run-donttest` when the suggested packages are available.

## CRAN

- Added `cran-comments.md`. The package passes `R CMD check --as-cran` with no errors or warnings; remaining notes (new submission, cosmetic pragmas in the vendored nlohmann/json headers) are documented for the reviewer.

# ppforest2 0.1.0

## New features

- Projection-pursuit oblique decision trees and random forests for classification, using LDA/PDA optimization.
- `pptr()` and `pprf()` with formula and matrix interfaces. Returned models carry an S3 class vector identifying both model type and mode (e.g. `c("pprf_classification", "pprf", "ppmodel")`).
- `predict()` returns group labels (`type = "class"`) or vote proportions (`type = "prob"`) for classification.
- Random uniform variable selection per split for forest diversity.
- Three variable importance measures: permuted (VI1), projections (VI2), and weighted projections (VI3). Permuted variable importance may be negative; this is meaningful signal ("within noise") rather than a sentinel, so callers should rely on the ranking rather than clipping at zero. Weighted projection importance is non-negative by construction.
- Out-of-bag error and confusion matrix for forests, with bootstrap sample indices persisted for recomputation.
- Lazy OOB accessors — `oob_error()`, `oob_predictions()`, `oob_samples()`, `bag_samples()`, `permuted_importance()`, `weighted_importance()` — compute from the training data stored on the model on first access and memoize in an environment cache, so training is fast and repeated access is free. `oob_error()` is `NA_real_` and `oob_predictions()` returns a factor with `NA` for rows with no OOB tree.
- `summary()` displays training and OOB confusion matrices.
- Degenerate split detection when projection pursuit cannot find a useful projection, surfaced as a warning.
- OpenMP multi-threaded forest training.
- `save_json()` and `load_json()` for model persistence. Optional metrics fields use a uniform `null`-or-value representation so downstream tooling can distinguish "computed but empty" from other shapes without special-casing.
- Cross-platform reproducibility — identical results for the same seed on Linux, macOS, and Windows, enforced by golden-file tests in CI.
- tidymodels/parsnip integration: `pp_tree()` and `pp_rand_forest()` model specifications.
- ggplot2 visualizations — tree diagrams, variable importance plots, projection histograms, and decision boundary plots.
- Bundled classification datasets: crab, crabs, fishcatch, glass, image, leukemia, lymphoma, NCI60, olive, parkinson, and wine. (Use `datasets::iris` from base R for iris examples.)

## Experimental features

Regression support is included but untested in production workloads. API surface and defaults may change in future releases.

- Regression auto-detected when `y` is numeric (not a factor). `predict()` returns a numeric vector (`type = "response"`).
- Regression strategy wrappers: `grouping_by_cutpoint()`, `leaf_mean_response()`, `stop_min_size()`, `stop_min_variance()`, `stop_any()`. Training quantile-slices the continuous response into groups and fits mean-response leaves.
- `summary()` displays MSE / MAE / R² for regression models, computed for training and out-of-bag predictions; forest OOB error is reported as MSE. `oob_predictions()` returns a numeric vector with `NA_real_` for rows with no OOB tree.
- `save_json()` / `load_json()` preserve regression mode; parsnip `pp_tree()` / `pp_rand_forest()` accept `mode = "regression"`.
- Bundled regression dataset `california_housing` (20,433 × 9, predict `median_house_value`). For smaller regression examples use `datasets::mtcars` from base R.
